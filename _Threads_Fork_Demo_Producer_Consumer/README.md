#_Threads_Fork_Demo_Producer_Consumer

Hey guys!

Compile and run both codes on separate terminals, \
and type your message in producer process, \
to demonstrate Producer-Consumer model.

run test.sh for generating 'mainProd' and 'mainCon' executables.
run ./mainProd and then ./mainCon on 2 different terminals..
Write in mainProd and expect the string character wise on mainCon terminal.
